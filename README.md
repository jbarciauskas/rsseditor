RSS Editor
=============

The goal here is to be able to create a webapp that will load an RSS feed, allow the user to make in-line changes to it through fun AJAX-y controls and postbacks, and then save / host the edited RSS feed.

The motivation for this project came from observing that many of the [UC Berkeley webcasts](http://webcast.berkeley.edu/) had fun titles like "Lecture 34" rather than the actual topic that was covered, so I want to edit and save custom versions of feeds for classes I'm interested in.
